Guess 1. Search will always return true no matter what's the number you want to search.
Guess 2. When remove nodes from the list, size won't reduce.
Guess 3. IsEmpty will return true when there are some nodes in the list.
Guess 4. addBack, addFront, removeBack and removeFront seems to work. I am guessing that addBack will addFront or removeBack will removeFront and vice versa.

These are my best guesses \(^_^)/!
